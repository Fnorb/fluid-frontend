### Author: Arkadij Liebau

## ‚ú® Overview

This repository contains a responsive onepager, that features an animated gooey-background as well as a text-transformation component (which briefly explains the appllied technologies). In addition there are unit tests, visual regression tests, and there is a deployment script.

- `npm run build`: builds the project for production
- `npm run preview`: serves the built project locally
- `npm run test`: runs unit tests
- `npm run type-check`: performs TypeScript type checking
- `npm run deploy-to-pages`: executes the deploy.cjs to push the compiled pager into the gh-pages worktree which his then published on GitHub Pages

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

This project leverages the following key technologies and libraries:

- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: The core framework for building the user interface, utilizing the Composition API for modular and reactive components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a consistent design across devices.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript animation library used for creating the smooth, performance-friendly animations, including the gooey background effects and the character transformations in the `TextTransformer`.
  - Specifically, `MotionPathPlugin` is used for complex character movement.
- **CSS Houdini (Paint Worklet)**: A custom paint worklet (`squircle.min.js`) is employed to draw dynamic squirclets in the background, showcasing advanced CSS capabilities.
- **Vite**: A fast development build tool for Vue projects, providing quick hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **Vitest**: A blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite, used for efficient component testing.
- **@vue/test-utils**: Vue.js testing utilities for mounting and interacting with Vue components in tests.
- **BackstopJS**: A visual regression testing framework to ensure UI consistency across changes.
- **Normalize.css**: A small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
- **Autoprefixer & PostCSS**: Tools for processing CSS, automatically adding vendor prefixes and enabling modern CSS features.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved code maintainability throughout the project.
- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment used for development scripts and deployment.
